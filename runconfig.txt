Converged App Requirements 

direct hit Objective
During the registration & onboarding, display only the permission requests required by the OS and specific subscriptions.  Any non-essential permissions should be moved out of the onboarding flow to context-specific presentations.

 

As a user, I want to be presented with as few screens as possible between the first registration screen and the app home screen.

reminder to switch to permission to always (BLE readers, non-app-tap/biometric)

as a user, I should be reminded to switch my location permission to always so that I can use my app without having to bring the app into the foreground

if location is set to always, hands free will work in background

 

Hands-free works if location is set to "Always". If set to "While Using," provisional background access is granted but reminders will prompt a switch.

 

if location is set to “when using the app”, then initially hands free will work when app is in background (swiped off) and then the app will keep reminding you if you decline to switch the permission then the provisional access to background will be removed and you must bring app in foreground to use it hands free. All modes of operation need the app in the foreground

Ability to dismiss permission switch reminder

as a user, I should be able to turn off reminders to change my permission settings to always

 

User can dismiss reminders and stop receiving location permission prompts.

 

 

No reminder to switch to permission to always (app-tap/biometric readers)

as a user who only has readers in my scope that are app-tap/biometric/or other app-required mode of operation, I do not need to be reminded to set my  location permission to always since I have to interact with the app to unlock the door

 

No reminders are displayed for users whose access methods require app interaction.

 

 

No reminder to switch to permission to always (NFC-only readers)

as a user who only has NFC-only readers in my scope, I do not need to be reminded to set my location permission to always

 

No reminders are displayed for users whose access methods require NFC interaction.

Android 11 and below Permissions
 

Note: As we have set the minimum target to Android 12, it is essential to verify that dependencies are compatible with Android 12 or higher. We need to update each library accordingly, and this update will align with SDK 5.0 and Converged 8.0.

Date Answered

Are we supporting Android 11 or below? Since Google no longer provides security updates for these versions, we should consider moving to Android 12 and above. Please share your thoughts on this.


3/20/25: Android 11 and below not supported in the converged app

Location permission required for geofence range detection. Once the user enters the geofence, the reader location is triggered, and based on this, the profile  needs to be updated. Could you please confirm if this approach is correct?  @Ritesh Dubey1 @Umesh Kanyal @Longo, Jeffrey @Wilfert, Hallie @Reimer, Michael @Mohammad Asif 

 

4/09/25: I’m not sure I understand the question.  If no one else can confirm, then we can discuss on our next call. @Umesh Kanyal @Longo, Jeffrey @Ritesh Dubey1 @Reimer, Michael @Mohammad Asif @Priti Tripathi 

@Wilfert, Hallie Can you confirm whether the Physical Activity Permission is required, or can it be removed? It is currently used for battery optimization. @Ritesh Dubey1 @Umesh Kanyal @Rahul Pandey 

 

@Priti Tripathi  - Physical activity permission is removed from the onboarding flow. However, it is tied to functionality that we are using on the Battery Savings page. Seehttps://kastlesystems.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/Requiremen/pages/3700359169

  @Umesh Kanyal @Longo, Jeffrey @Ritesh Dubey1 @Reimer, Michael @Mohammad Asif @Priti Tripathi 

@Wilfert, Hallie Can you confirm whether the Schedule Exact Alarm is required, or can it be removed? @Rahul Pandey @Ritesh Dubey1 @Umesh Kanyal 

 

@Priti Tripathi 

This permission can be removed since we have removed the “set office hours” functionality.  See
